# Java Fundamentals: Syntax & Semantics

## ✅ Definition
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that define how Java programs are written. If syntax rules are violated, the compiler throws an error.  
- **Semantics**: The meaning behind correctly written code. Even if code compiles, semantics determine whether it behaves as intended.  
*(Ref: [Java Language Specification, §1.1, §3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/))*

## ✅ Why Important?
- **Syntax** ensures your code can compile and run.  
- **Semantics** ensures your code produces correct results.  
- Both are necessary to build maintainable, error-free applications and real-world projects.

---

## ✅ Where Used?
- **Syntax**: Always, in every Java program. Example: placing a semicolon after a statement, using braces for blocks.  
- **Semantics**: While designing logic—e.g., knowing what `==` vs `.equals()` means.

## ✅ When to Focus?
- **Syntax**: During initial learning and writing code under time pressure (like coding rounds).  
- **Semantics**: During debugging, interviews (trick questions on logic), and writing scalable applications.
